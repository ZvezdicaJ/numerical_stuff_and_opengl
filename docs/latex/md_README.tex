\subsubsection*{Running benchmarks}

There is an unfinished script in benchmarks directory called run\+\_\+benchmarks.\+sh. For now, all it does, is that it sets the cpu frequency to 2000\+M\+Hz, or at least it is supposed to. Before running the script one has to build sort\+\_\+benchmarks. Benchmarks require you to install \href{https://github.com/google/benchmark}{\tt google benchmark} library.

\subsubsection*{Running tests}

To run the tests make run\+Tests. Tests require you to install \href{https://github.com/google/googletest}{\tt googletest} library.
